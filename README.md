# Even or Odd Number Checker (C++)

This is a simple C++ program that takes an integer number from the user
and checks whether the number is even or odd.

## 🧠 How It Works
- The program asks the user to enter a number.
- It uses the modulo operator (%) to determine if the number is divisible by 2.
- If the remainder is 0, the number is even.
- Otherwise, the number is odd.

## 🛠 Requirements
- C++ compiler (GCC, Clang, MSVC, etc.)

## ▶️ How to Run
1. Compile the program:
   g++ even_or_odd.cpp -o even_or_odd
2. Run it:
   ./even_or_odd

## 📌 Output Example
Enter your number: 4  
Your number is even.
